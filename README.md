# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results - Four Tables
### A Retirement Titles table was created to show employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and the table was exported as retirement_titles.csv. This table had duplicate lines for the same employee if the employee had changed titles during their tenure at the company.
### A Unique Titles table was created with the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title. The code for the Unique Titles table eliminated duplicate entries for employees. The Unique Titles table was exported as unique_titles.csv.
### A Retiring Titles table was executed to show the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring. The Retiring Titles table was exported as retiring_titles.csv. The table is linked here (https://github.com/sjhennessy/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Module_7%20_Deliverable_1.PNG).
### A Mentorship Eligibility table was created with data that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. These employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The Mentorship Eligibility table was exported and saved as mentorship_eligibility.csv.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
